# API Documentation

We provide API libraries for Cat++, Purrl, Catskell, Pascat, Objective Cat, and KittyScript.

Our RESTful architecture ensures all felids can nap without being restricted to a particular platform, scratching post, or bed.


### AUTHENTICATION

We use a proprietary OAuth implementation that ultimately rests on you being accepted by the particular cat object with which you wish to interact. We recommend not being too eager (make soft, gentle API calls until the cat trusts you)


### API Calls:

`PET /cat/:name/
