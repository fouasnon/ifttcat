# API Documentation

We provide API libraries for Cat++, Purrl, Catskell, Pascat, Objective Cat, and KittyScript.

Our RESTful architecture ensures all felids can nap without being restricted to a particular platform, scratching post, or bed.


### AUTHENTICATION

We use a proprietary OAuth implementation that ultimately rests on you being accepted by the particular cat object with which you wish to interact. We recommend not being too eager â€” make soft, gentle API calls until the cat trusts you. Completely ignoring the cat is the best way to ensure an valid HTTP response.


### API Calls:

`PET /cat/:name/
